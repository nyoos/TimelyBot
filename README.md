<h1> TimelyBot </h1>

Predicting the future to create a punctual present. TimelyBot evaluates how tardy your friends have been to give them an earlier meeting that makes them finally on time.

<h1> What it does </h1>

TimelyBot is a meetup scheduler built on a telegram bot that helps you arrange meetup timings with your friends to ensure that everyone comes on time. 
TimelyBot does this by keeping track of how early or late users have been, and calculates a weighted timedelta which is then added to the meeting time that a given person sees.

TimelyBot was built with python-telegram-bot and MongoDB.
